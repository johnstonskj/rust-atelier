# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project continue to grow and improve.

1. file [bugs](../../issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md) and
   [enhancement requests](../../issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md)
2. review the project documentation know if you find are issues, or missing content, there
3. Fix or Add something and send us a pull request;  you may like to pick up one of the issues marked [help wanted](../../labels/help%20wanted) or [good first issue](../../labels/good%20first%20issue) as an introduction. Alternatively, [documentation](../../labels/documentation) issues can be a great way to understand the project and help improve the developer experience.

## Submitting changes


We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [License](./LICENSE).

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:johnstonskj/{{repository-name}}.git

Ensure you have a good Rust install, usually managed by [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
You can ensure the latest tools with the following:

    rustup update

Make sure the tests pass:

    cargo test --package {{package-name}} --no-fail-fast --all-features -- --exact

Make your change. Add tests, and documentation, for your change. Ensure not only that tests pass, but the following all run successfully.

    cargo doc --all-features --no-deps
    cargo fmt
    cargo clippy

If you made changes to the book source, ensure the following runs successfully

    mdbook build

If you have made any changes to `Cargo.toml`, also check:

    cargo outdated
    cargo audit

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](../../compare/) using our [template](./pull_request_template.md).

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write unit tests. 
* Write API documentation.
* Write a [good commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

## Coding conventions

The primary tool for coding conventions is rustfmt, and specifically `cargo fmt` is a part of the build process and will cause Actions to fail. 

DO NOT create or update any existing `rustfmt.toml` file to change the default formatting rules.

DO NOT alter any `warn` or `deny` library attributes. 

DO NOT add any `feature` attributes that would prohibit building on the stable channel. In some cases new crate-level features can be used to introduce an unstable feature dependency but these MUST be clearly documented and optional.
